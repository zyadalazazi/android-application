For Sprint 1, I worked on how to create the forgot password activity and learned how to use Firebase. Nawfel worked on implementing the login screen and the homepage and connecting the homepage to all the other team&#39;s activities. Zyad worked on linking the first activity to the second activity and implementing the first activity of the profile view. Rayan worked on the CreateAccount activity. I accomplished fully implementing the forgot password activity by connecting our app to the firebase database. Nawfel accomplished the creation of login and homepage screens and also implemented user registration and login successfully with firebase. Ziad accomplished the enabling the user to input the data and edit the profile. Rayan accomplished the task of creating account pages and implementing exception handling for invalid user inputs and also sending error messages to users when input is wrong.

At first I had issues on creating the AVD emulator. I also had issues on how to send an email link to the user for password reset. During the firebase implementation, I was getting errors for grade sync issues in the grade.build. Nawfel had issues with storing the login users, git regarding merge, and how to deal with relative layout. Ziad had problems with designing the scrollable activity and travelling and internet connection issues. Rayan had issues on where to store info inputted by the user, how to pull the source code on github and how to merge it when done with it, ensuring that the users check one of the boxes, ensuring that the user selects one of the radio buttons. We need to modify our goals for Sprint 2 by having each member complete 3-4 user stories and less researching and more of the doing the work. Also, make sure that we have 1-2 days for junit testing before the deadline.
